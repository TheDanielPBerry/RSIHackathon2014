        <h1>Brief History</h1>
        <p>In the early 1800's, most physicians in America had no formal degrees. Instead, they trained as apprentices for a few years to learn their trade. There were fewer than 100 physicians in Georgia. As the number of medical schools in the U.S. increased, so did the number of Georgia physicians with degrees.</p>
        <p>In 1822, several Augusta area physicians organized the Medical Society of Augusta. They apparently hoped to start a school in Augusta, but no formal plans were drawn up by this group.</p>
        <p>In 1826 Dr. Milton Antony, a leader in local medical circles, began to teach apprentices in two borrowed rooms of the City Hospital (opened in 1818). Dr. Antony had trained under the preceptor system, attending only one formal course of lectures at the University of Pennsylvania. He was unable to return for the second required term because of finances and so did not receive his degree. After about fifteen years of active practice in Georgia and Louisiana, he received his M.D. "ad eundum" in 1825 from the Medical College of South Carolina.</p>
        <p>With strong local backing, Dr. Antony journeyed to Milledgeville, then the state capital, seeking a charter. The Medical Academy of Georgia was chartered by the State in an act that was signed into law on December 20, 1828, by then-Governor John Forsyth of Augusta.</p>
        <p>The first class at the Academy began on October 1, 1829, in rooms of the City Hospital that had been renovated and equipped by the faculty at a cost of $457.13. There were seven students at that first session.</p>
        <p>On December 19, 1829, the General Assembly authorized the school to grant the M.D. degree and changed the name to the Medical Institute of Georgia. The first formal commencement was held on April 7, 1833, with four graduates. It was also in 1833 that the school received its present name, the Medical College of Georgia. It was with this name that the first diplomas were engraved and awarded.</p>
        <p>In 1834 construction of the stately Medical College building on Telfair Street was begun. The legislature, pleased with the progress of the school in Augusta, appropriated $10,000, along with 50 lots on the town common of Augusta to be sold, the proceeds to be paid over to the College. The city gave $5,000, in return for medical care for the city's prisoners and the poor at City Hospital. The remarkable domed building was occupied in 1835, completed in 1836, and served as the main teaching facility for the school until the end of 1912.</p>
        <p>In January of 1913, the school moved to larger quarters in the Newton Building some distance away. The original Medical College of Georgia building, still standing today, has come to symbolize the entire institution.</p>
        <p>The school grew and by the 1850s classes were large and well-attended--right up until December 20, 1860, when South Carolina seceded from the Union. Georgia took the same course on January 19, 1861. During the war the school was closed, and the Medical College building itself was converted into a military hospital.</p>
        <p>MCG next held classes on November 6, 1865, with 47 students attending, including 3 Yankee soldiers. The first post-war commencement was held on February 24, 1866, with 9 students receiving degrees. It is a tribute to the strength and fortitude of the faculty of the College that they were able to reopen at all in the misery and deprivation of the post-war South.</p>
        <p>On July 5, 1873, following negotiations, a loose agreement was struck between the Medical College of Georgia and the University of Georgia in Athens. From 1873 to 1950 the school was called "The Medical College of Georgia, being the Medical Department of the University of Georgia."</p>
        <p>The first extant record of alumni organization was in 1891, when 15 alumni met to formally elect officers.</p>
        <p>MCG received a "class A" rating in 1907, but medical education was generally in a sorry state in the early 1900s. In 1910 Abraham Flexner published a scathing report that struck death blows to many proprietary medical schools. He recommended the immediate closing of the Medical College of Georgia. The faculty and the legislature acted quickly to bring MCG up to national standards. Unfortunately, the following 20 years saw a steady decline in the quality of operation of the Medical Department.</p>
        <p>In 1931 the dean resigned and many faculty followed. The Depression and Politics were in charge, not the educators. In 1833 the Board of Regents voted to close the Medical College. A storm of support failed to move the legislature until Mr. Roy V. Harris, Augusta legislator and long-time Speaker of the House of Representatives, managed to convince Governor Eugene Talmadge to change his vote on the Board of Regents. The other Regents soon saw the light and the school survived.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, in 1934 the AMA dropped the school from its "class A" list. In 1934 Dr. G. Lombard Kelly was named Dean and a massive program was undertaken to revitalize the College. Under his wise and vibrant leadership and with a strong base of support, the school returned to "class A" status in 1936.</p>
        <p>World War II increased the demand for physicians, and brought a number of non-Georgians to Augusta. In 1945 the legislature authorized the construction of a badly needed new teaching hospital. Recognizing the difficulties involved in running a growing medical institution and a major hospital from Athens, leaders granted independent university status within the University System of Georgia in 1950. The traditional name, Medical College of Georgia, was restored to the 122-year-old school. Dr. Kelly was named the first President of MCG.</p>
        <p>The new teaching hospital, Eugene Talmadge Memorial Hospital, opened in 1956, again in large part due to the efforts of Roy Harris in the General Assembly.</p>
        <p>The early 1950s marked the emergence of MCG as a health sciences university. The nursing program begin in 1894 had evolved into a local hospital nursing school. In 1956 it merged with a nursing program at the University of Georgia, and became the School of Nursing. The medical technology program, in operation since 1937, became a baccalaureate program in 1955. A medical illustration program initiated in 1949 awarded its first M.S. degree in 1951.</p>
        <p>Radiologic technology and medical record administration programs were established in 1962. Ph.D. programs were begun in 1963, which led to the establishment of a School of Graduate Studies in 1966. A School of Dentistry was approved in 1965, accepted its first students in 1969, and graduated its first DMDs in 1973.</p>
        <p>An associated dental sciences program was started in 1967. The School of Allied Health Sciences combined this program with other disciplines in 1968, and grew to include nine major disciplines. A master of science in nursing program was started in 1968. Programs in physical therapy, occupational therapy, and respiratory therapy followed. A master of health education in many of these disciplines was approved in 1974.</p>
        <p>The physical plant grew to include dozens of state-of-the-art facilities. It is difficult to believe that the very existence of this medical university was threatened so many times during its first 150 years. Despite its on-again off-again administrative relationship with the University of Georgia, a steady stream of UGA students have passed through MCG, creating a dual alumni loyalty that remains strong and unbreakable today.</p>

During this time only one woman applied but was denied entry. More fascinating history information listed below:</p><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Dr. Milton Antony (1789-1839) 
            Founding Faculty: Chief Founder
            <p>Despite a limited early education, Dr. Milton Antony began to study medicine at age 16 as an apprentice. He took a course in Philadelphia but could not afford to continue and never received a diploma. He began his practice in rural Georgia, and soon built up a large practice. After seven years, he moved to New Orleans for a short while and returned to Augusta in 1819. He became very active professionally and determined to improve the quality of his profession in Georgia. He was a member of the Medical Society of Georgia and with his urging, the Medical Board of Georgia was established which regulated the practice of medicine. In 1828, Dr. Antony, along with three other physicians, founded an academy of medicine to prepare students for further medical studies, soon expanded to become the Medical College of Georgia. He shepherded the building of a permanent home for the new school, which resulted in an impressive Greek Revival building. In 1836, he and his colleague, Dr. Joseph Adams Eve, began the Southern Medical and Surgical Journal to report the medical advances and practices of the South. Besides Dr. Antony's contributions to the profession itself, he was also a fine surgeon, and reported on his bold surgery to remove a portion of a diseased lung by partially removing the fifth and sixth ribs. Dr. Antony enjoyed an excellent reputation both in and outside the state. As the yellow fever epidemic swept through Augusta in 1839, Dr. Antony became one of its victims. He was buried on the grounds of the original Medical College of Georgia building.</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Dr. Joseph Adams Eve (1805-1886) 
            Founding Faculty
            <p>Dr. Joseph Adams Eve studied medicine under Dr. Milton Antony. After continuing his studies in Europe and the Medical College of South Carolina, he returned to Augusta in 1828 to practice and joined Dr. Antony as a founding faculty member of the Medical College of Georgia. He served first as chair of materia medica, then as chair of obstetrics and diseases of women and children for over 50 years. He was an editor of the Southern Medical and Surgical Journal and wrote many valuable articles for the profession.</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Dr. Lewis Ford (1801-1883) 
            Dean, 1829-1836
            <p>Dr. Lewis Ford was educated in New York and moved south to practice medicine in 1822. He was a founding father of the Medical College of Georgia and taught there for 50 years. He was well known for his benevolence and encouraged this attitude in his students as a duty of the profession. He was an expert on epidemic diseases and advocated better sanitary conditions to improve the health of the citizens. He served as president of the Board of Health of Augusta for several years and was chosen as first president of the Georgia Medical Association when it was organized in 1849. He served on the Augusta city council and was elected mayor in 1846. He served the Confederacy in the Civil War despite being 60 years old at the time. A resolution from the faculty of the Medical College of Georgia upon his death stated "...he will long be remembered as one of the founders of medical science in our State....an early cultivator of correct methods of medical reasoning, and....to the founding of a sound medical philosophy not only in his own State but through the entire South."</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Dr. Paul Fitzsimmons Eve (1806-1877) 
            Dean, 1836-1844
            <p>Dr. Paul F. Eve sought the best when acquiring his medical education throughout his life. He received his MD degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1828, and then studied in Europe under some of the finest physicians and in the best clinics of the time. Also an adventurer, he participated in the Paris Revolution of 1830 and in the Polish bid for independence as a soldier and surgeon. After his appointment to the Medical College of Georgia faculty as professor of surgery in 1832, he became a well-known teacher and surgeon and contributed to the growth and reputation of the new school. He served as dean from 1836-1844 and as an editor of the Southern Medical and Surgical Journal for the next five years. He was a prolific writer throughout his lifetime and was just as likely to record his failures as his successes. Dr. Eve was unafraid to express strong opinions on a topic. In an editorial note about an article on mesmerism promoted by his friend and colleague, Dr. Dugas, provides an example. He writes in the 1845 issue, "Viewing Mesmerism in the light I do, I regret the space occupied by it in the Journal..." in 1850, Dr. Eve left Augusta to continue his teaching and surgical practice in Louisville, St. Louis and Nashville where his reputation continued to climb. His interest in military causes also continued as he observed two battles in the Franco-Austrian War of 1859 and served the Confederacy during the Civil War. He provided leadership in professional organizations and served as president of the American Medical Association in 1857-58 and as Centennial Representative to the Medical Congress of Nations in 1876. The Polish government, 100 years after Dr. Eve's contributions during the Polish war, remembered him by erecting a monument in Augusta. A commemorative stamp honoring Dr. Eve was also issued by the Polish government. The medical community will remember Dr. Eve as one of the leading surgeons and medical educators of his time.</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Dr. George Madison Newton (1810-1859) 
            Dean, 1844-1857
            <p>Dr. George Newton was raised in Augusta and earned a bachelor's of medicine from the Medical Academy of Georgia. He then obtained his MD degree from the University Of Pennsylvania School Of Medicine. He was appointed to the faculty of the Medical College of Georgia in 1833, and served as chair of anatomy and dean of the faculty. Because of his family's financial position, he was the first faculty member to devote his time fully to teaching, administration and civic duties without having a private practice of medicine. He joined his stepfather, Isaac Tuttle, in providing philanthropic care to the orphans of the city and their estates provided for the Augusta Orphanage Asylum (later known as the Newton Building).</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Dr. Ignatius Poltney Garvin (1804-1880) 
            Dean, 1857-1861
            <p>Dr. Ignatius Poultney Garvin graduated with the first graduating class of the Medical College of South Carolina in 1825. He was a founding member of the Board of Trustees and a member of the original faculty of the Medical College of Georgia. In 1829, he held the professor of anatomy and surgery chair for one year, and then he left to pursue private practice. In 1839, MCG named him professor of materia medica and therapeutics, and from 1857-1861, he served as dean. After the devastating yellow fever epidemic of 1839 in Augusta, Dr. Garvin and colleagues were appointed to study its causes, and the subsequent report was hailed as a valuable contribution to medical literature. His school and his family were greatly affected by the epidemic, as one of its victims was Dr. Milton Antony, founder of the school and father of Dr. Garvin's wife, Sarah Ann. He was elected to represent the school at the national medical convention in 1847 where he proposed implementing educational standards for all medical schools, a theme common to the founding fathers. Besides his active professional life, he also participated in the civic affairs of Augusta. He was elected mayor of Augusta in 1848 and also served as treasurer of Augusta for over 15 years. He retired from MCG in 1867.</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Dr. Louis Alexander Dugas (1806-1884) 
            Dean, 1861-1876 and First Librarian
            <p>Dr. Louis Dugas came from an accomplished and well-educated French West Indies family. He studied under renowned professors and physicians in Philadelphia, Maryland and France. In 1831, he joined the MCG faculty. In 1834, each faculty member contributed $1,000 for him to go to Europe to purchase materials for a library and museum. He returned with a fine and valuable collection, most of which has been preserved and is currently housed in the Historical Collections of the Greenblatt Library. His service as dean came during the trying times of the Civil War and its aftermath. He served as editor of the Southern Medical and Surgical Journal for seven years and made voluminous contributions to medical literature. He developed a test for dislocation of the shoulder still used today (Dugas sign). He was often far ahead of his time in medical practice. His insights into the origins of yellow fever foreshadowed the discovery of its transmission by mosquito and he used animal sutures years before it became commonplace. He was the only surgeon south of Virginia to perform the Civiale technique of lithotrity (crushing a urinary stone within the bladder), and the only U.S. surgeon performing ligature of the ischiatic artery for aneurysm. He outlined a bold approach for treating abdominal wounds with which he claimed success. One of his more controversial techniques was the use of a hypnotic trance on a patient during surgery who reported no pain. He also was involved with civic affairs, serving on the City Council repeatedly, and helped erect the Signers Monument recognizing the three Georgia signers of the Declaration of Independence.</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Dr. Henry William DeSaussure Ford (1834-1906) 
            Dean, 1876-1880, 1893-1894, 1903-1906
            <p>As the son of the first dean of the Medical College of Georgia, Dr. DeSaussure Ford received his education at Richmond Academy, University of Georgia and Medical College of Georgia. He immediately took a position in Philadelphia, but left at the outbreak of the Civil War. After serving the Confederacy as a surgeon, he returned to MCG as professor of anatomy. He helped found the "New" City Hospital and chaired its governing board. He was involved in other civic activities as a City Council member, president of Richmond Academy, physician to the Augusta Orphanage Asylum and Tubman Home and surgeon to the Georgia railroad and other railroads in the south. He had the unusual distinction of serving as dean of the Medical College of Georgia three times in four decadesa testimony to his ability and character as a leader.</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Col. George Washington Rains (1817-1898) 
            Dean, 1880-1884
            <p>Col. George W. Rains served the Medical Department of the University of Georgia after spending more than two decades as a military man, chemist, and engineer. In 1842 he graduated from West Point Military Academy in scientific studies and rose through the ranks of the Army to major during the Mexican War. In the late 1850s he resigned from the Army and secured patents on inventions related to steam engines. During the Civil War, he served as a colonel in the Confederacy. He chose Augusta as the site for the Confederate Powder Works and developed the best powder works in the country, receiving a patent relating to the production of gunpowder. After the war, he remained in Augusta and joined the Department's faculty as professor of chemistry and received an honorary MD degree. He was interested in improving the public health of the citizens and designed sewage facilities while also serving on the Board of Health. He served as dean of the Medical Department from 1880-1884 and continued as faculty until his retirement in 1894.</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Dr. Edward Geddings (1833-1906) 
            Dean, 1884-1893
            <p>Dr. Edward Geddings graduated from the University of Berlin with high honors in 1854. He also received his MD degree in Berlin, and then returned to Charleston, S.C. to practice medicine before and after the Civil War. During the war, he served as a surgeon with the rank of major. In 1866, he joined the MCG faculty and remained affiliated for the next 25 years. He eschewed superstition and sought out the truths of medical practice and was known throughout the state as a physician/educator who influenced many students with his teaching methods.</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Dr. Thomas Russell Wright (1855-1923) 
            Dean, 1894-1896
            <p>Dr. Thomas Wright received his MD degree from the Medical Department of the University of Georgia in 1876. He taught at the Medical Department for 47 years, first as professor of anatomy and later as professor of surgery. He was known as a skillful surgeon. Dr. Wright became dean during a national depression, but he improved the college's financial aspects by the time his tenure ended. He was also actively involved in developing University Hospital. Dr. Wright wanted to increase the Medical Departments visibility in the community and was instrumental in the faculty and students wearing caps and gowns for the first time at the 1899 commencement.</p><br>
            </li>
            <li>Dr. Eugene Foster (1850-1903) 
            Dean, 1896-1903
            <p>Dr. Eugene Foster was born in Augusta and received his M.D. degree from the Medical College of Georgia in 1872. He did postgraduate work at University Medical College in New York, and then returned to Augusta to oversee the smallpox hospital. He was an advocate for public health programs throughout his life, serving on the Augusta Board of Health, backing Augusta’s implementation of its sewerage system, and being an active member of the American Public Health Association. While dean of the Medical Department of the University of Georgia, he lobbied to require four years for the medical degree in order to expand the curriculum to include emerging knowledge, such as bacteriology. In 1892, Dr. Foster gave the address at the first annual alumni association meeting in conjunction with commencement. He urged more cooperation among doctors and lashed out against quacks. As a proponent of using sound business principles to run the institution, his term as dean saw prosperous times, and he improved the physical plant with new equipment and expanded facilities. Dr. Foster died of cancer in January 1903.
            Dean Eugene Foster's tenure included many changes at MCG. Mrs. O’Connor became the first woman to apply to the school, but the faculty adamantly denied her admission.

            <li>Dr. Joseph Eve Allen (1862-1915) 
            Dean, 1906-1910
            <p>Dr. Joseph Eve Allen was born in Augusta and was the grandson and namesake of Joseph Eve, an MCG founder. He was educated in Augusta, received his MD degree from the Medical Department of the University of Georgia in 1877 and spent his career with the institution in obstetrics and pediatrics. In 1896, he became the center of controversy upon his address on Darwinian Evolution, which some in the community considered an attack on religion. In 1906, when he was named dean, his popularity with the students was such that they hoisted him on their shoulders and carried him into the assembly.</p><br>

            <li>Dr. William Henry Doughty, Jr. (1856-1923) 
            Dean, 1910-1923 The last Dean to hold office at The Old Medical College of Georgia Campus.
            <p>Dr. William Henry Doughty, a native Augustan, received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Georgia in 1875 and a degree of Doctor of Medicine three years later in 1878. After completing postgraduate studies in New York City, he began his practice in Augusta, and in 1881, began his career at the Medical Department as assistant demonstrator of anatomy and clinical assistant. In 1910, after many years as professor of surgery, he assumed the deanship. He continued in this position until 1923 when he died from a gas bacillus that developed following a tooth extraction.
            Dr. Doughty guided the Medical Department through a stormy period following the publication of the Flexner Report on medical education. During his tenure, a new committee on curriculum was formed, a new set of bylaws and rules governing the faculty was put into place and a board of directors was created. Dr. Doughty’s time in office essentially changed the old face of the college. He brought in grants and community backing to fund more full-time faculty members and faculty chairs which enabled the school to produce "an all-round physician." Dr. Doughty helped relocate the Medical Department to the Newton Building and establish University Hospital.

        <h1>GRANDISON HARRIS – “The Resurrection Man”</h1><br>
        <p>Grandison Harris was a black man born in the year of 1816 in West Africa. In 1852, then 36 years old, Grandison  found himself on the slave auction block in Charleston, South Carolina. That day the dean of the Medical College in Augusta, Georgia came to Charleston to bid on a slave. He saw Grandison Harris and bid $700. He won the bid, and Grandison Harris came to Augusta, Georgia. Now Grandison left his wife, who was pregnant, back in Charleston.</p><br>
        <p>It was against the law to teach slaves how to read or write, but the doctors taught Grandison Harris how to read and write because they knew it would be an important part of his job. The Medical College needed to get cadavers, dead bodies, so the medical students could dissect them. In the past they had offered 75¢ per body, but few people had taken them up on the offer. This would be the job of Grandison Harris.</p><br>
        <p>When the newspaper was printed, Grandison would read it seeing who had died and when they were supposed to be buried. The main cemetery for black folks was Cedar Grove Cemetery. Grandson would read and when he found someone was being buried he would go to work. That night, late at night, he would take his cart, sack{s} and shovel. He would quietly go into the cemetery and find the grave.</p><br>
        <p>He would look and remember how everything was and then dig down to the body. If the body was in a casket, Grandison would break into the end of the casket. Then with a firm grip, and strong-arms he would pull the body out.</p><br>
        <p>He would then put the body into a bag and load it on his cart. Grandison Harris would then put everything back on the grave, in its original position. People could not tell the grave had been tampered with. At that time, he would roll the cart back to the Medical College on Telfair Street. The bodies would be dissected and used to teach the students about the human body.</p><br>
        <p>The faculty and the students knew about the work of Grandison Harris. Around the school he became known as the “Resurrection Man.” This term came from “Body snatching” which is the secret disinterment of corpses from graveyards. A common purpose of body snatching, especially in the 19th century, was to sell the corpses for dissection or anatomy lectures in medical schools. Those who practiced body snatching were often called "resurrectionists" or "resurrection-men". Grave robbing was, of course, illegal, but the crime was often ignored, and the Medical School’s faculty was never reprimanded. When the Civil War ended, slavery ended. Harris’s wife and child, George, moved from Charleston, South Carolina, to live with him in Augusta, Georgia.  Grandison Harris briefly left the school, but he returned a short time later, hired as a porter getting paid $8 dollars a month.</p><br>
        <p>Just think, in 1852 on the slave auction block, Harris didn’t know what he was going to be doing. Would he be working on a plantation, as a horseman, or in his master’s house? But as fate would have it, he went to work for a Medical College. In the college, Harris set in on anatomy classes. In 1889, as word spread throughout the black community about the use of their dead from Cedar Grove Cemetery for dissections, authorities faced civil disobedience. The school almost had its own riot. There is no record of what calmed the storm in the black community, but it was calmed.</p><br>
        <p>In 1908 an enfeebled Harris made his last appearance at the school. In 1911, Grandison Harris died of heart failure at the age of 95. Three days later, he was laid to rest in the cemetery that knew him well, Cedar Grove Cemetery. For the next 100 years, people would mention the “Resurrection Man”. Most people would hear bits and pieces and thought of it as an old wives tale. It couldn’t be true. In 1989, the old Medical College building, built in 1835, was getting a “face lift.” The construction workers were tearing up the floor in the old kitchen and found a bone, a human bone. In a few minutes they found another bone. By the time they got the floor up they discovered there were hundreds of human bones. The authorities say 350 to 450 people were buried there. They couldn’t give an exact number. Some of the bones had specimen numbers written on them; a large wooden vat holding dozens of bones was also found. Workers found another vat that held body parts still preserved in whiskey.</p><br>
        <p>Well, what was the Medical College of Georgia supposed to do? They knew the bones were from the work of Grandison Harris. When the students dissected the bodies, they were buried in the Medical College building and lime was used to cut down the smell. All of the bones were put in a large crate, and given to the city of Augusta. In the year 1998 the crate of bones was laid to rest in Cedar Grove Cemetery.</p><br>
        <br><p>“BONES IN THE BASEMENT” published in 1997 by Robert Blakely (Author), Judith M. 
Harrington discusses this historical event.  An editorial review by the Library Journal
states:  In 1989, workers restoring the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta made a grisly 
discovery: over 9000 human bones/ remains of bodies autopsied by medical students and 
faculty, were buried in the building's basement.  Blakely (director, Ctr. for Applied Research 
in Anthropology, Georgia State Univ.)  began coordinating a study of the basement's contents 
by a multidisciplinary team of archaeologists, anthropologists, historians, anatomists, 
and ethnographers. They determined that more than 75 percent of the bones were 
African American, silent testimony to the marginalization of Augusta's slave and free black 
communities. Human dissection was illegal in Georgia until 1887, most of the cadavers 
were certainly procured by grave robbers.</p><br>
